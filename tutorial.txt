Hey UC family,

Here’s the firmware I promised! The process is simple—just follow these steps:

1. **Open CMD as Administrator**
2. Navigate to the folder where the firmware is located:
- Copy the file location (e.g., `C:\Users\Downloads\itsmemadd`).
- In CMD, type: `cd C:\Users\Downloads\itsmemadd` and press Enter.
3. Type `avrdude.exe` and press Enter.
4. Open `command.txt` and replace `COM9` with your hidden COM port (only change the number).
- Copy the full command from the file.
5. Go back to CMD, paste the command, and press Enter.
P.S if your arduino already spoofed, when you want to past the cmd make sure you press reset botton in the arduino to show the hiden com port 
- Voilà! Your Arduino is now flashed with what I’d call a decent firmware.

Note: The more this firmware gets resold by others, the higher the chances of it being detected—so let’s keep it simple and fair.

Enjoy the release, and have a great day!
Please do not ask for additional help with this. Thank you!
